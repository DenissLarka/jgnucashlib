/**
 * This class represents a bill that is sent from a vendor
 * so you know what to pay him/her.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note: The correct business term is "bill" (as opposed to "invoice"), 
 * as used in the GnuCash documentation. However, on a technical level, both 
 * customer invoices and vendor bills are referred to as "GncInvoice" objects.
 * <br>
 * Implementations of this interface are comparable and sorts primarily on the date the Invoice was
 * created and secondarily on the date it should be paid.
